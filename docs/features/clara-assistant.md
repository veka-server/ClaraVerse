    "datasets": [{
      "label": "Sales ($)",
      "data": [12000, 15000, 18000, 22000],
      "backgroundColor": ["#3B82F6", "#10B981", "#F59E0B", "#EF4444"]
    }]
  }
}
```

### 🔄 Mermaid Diagrams

**Process Flows and Architecture:**
```mermaid

```

## 🚀 Autonomous Mode

Clara can work independently to complete complex tasks:

### How Autonomous Mode Works

1. **Task Planning**: Clara breaks down complex requests into steps
2. **Tool Execution**: Uses available tools to complete each step
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks progress and adapts to challenges
4. **Result Validation**: Verifies work quality before completion

**Example Autonomous Task:**
```
User: "Build a complete todo application with React and TypeScript"

Clara's Autonomous Process:
1. 📋 Plan application structure
2. 🎨 Create component hierarchy
3. 💾 Implement state management
4. 🎯 Add CRUD operations
5. 🎨 Style with Tailwind CSS
6. 🧪 Add basic testing
7. ✅ Validate and document
```

### Tool Integration

**Available Tools:**
- File creation and editing
- Code execution and testing
- Web research and data gathering
- Image generation and processing
- API calls and integrations

**Tool Call Example:**
```typescript
// Clara can chain multiple tools
1. create_file("components/TodoList.tsx", todoListCode)
2. create_file("hooks/useTodos.ts", customHookCode)
3. edit_file("App.tsx", integrateComponents)
4. run_command("npm test")
5. create_file("README.md", documentation)
```

## 🔊 Voice Integration

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

**Natural Voice Output:**
- Multiple voice options
- Adjustable speed and pitch
- Background reading capability
- Code pronunciation optimization

**Usage:**
```typescript
// Clara reads responses aloud
User: "Explain async/await in JavaScript"
Clara: [Provides detailed explanation with voice narration]

// Configure TTS settings
Settings → Voice → Enable TTS
- Voice: Natural/Professional/Friendly
- Speed: 0.5x to 2.0x
- Pitch: -10 to +10
```

### Speech-to-Text (STT)

**Voice Input:**
- Hands-free interaction
- Code dictation
- Natural language commands
- Multi-language support

**Voice Commands:**
```
"Clara, create a new React component called UserProfile"
"Explain the code in the current file"
"Generate a function to sort an array of objects"
"Add error handling to this API call"
```

## 🎛️ Customization

### System Prompts

**Custom Behavior:**
Clara's behavior can be customized with system prompts:

```typescript
// Professional mode
"You are a senior software engineer focused on best practices, performance, and maintainable code."

// Creative mode
"You are a creative developer who thinks outside the box and suggests innovative solutions."

// Teaching mode
"You are a patient coding instructor who explains concepts clearly with examples."
```

### Provider Configuration

**Multi-Provider Setup:**
```typescript
// Local AI (Ollama)
- Model: llama2, codellama, mistral
- Endpoint: http://localhost:11434
- Benefits: Privacy, no cost, offline capable

// OpenAI
- Models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo
- Features: Function calling, vision
- Benefits: High quality, fast responses

```

## 📚 Advanced Features

### Session Management

**Conversation Persistence:**
- Automatic session saving
- Cross-session context
- Conversation history
- Session export/import

**Session Types:**
```typescript
// Quick Chat: Ephemeral conversations
// Project Session: Tied to specific projects
// Research Session: For exploration and learning
// Debug Session: For troubleshooting
```

### Background Operation

**Continuous Operation:**
Clara can continue working while you focus on other tasks:

- **Background Processing**: Long-running tasks continue
- **Progress Notifications**: Updates on task completion
- **Queue Management**: Multiple tasks in sequence
- **Resource Management**: Efficient system usage

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**External Tool Integration:**
Clara can integrate with external tools and services:

```typescript
// Available MCP Tools
- File system operations
- Git version control
- Database queries
- API testing
- Cloud services
- Development tools
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Effective Communication

**Clear Instructions:**
```
✅ Good: "Create a React component for a user profile card with name, email, avatar, and edit button"

❌ Vague: "Make a user component"
```

**Context Provision:**
```
✅ Good: "In this React TypeScript project using Tailwind CSS, add dark mode toggle to the navigation bar"

❌ Limited: "Add dark mode"
```

### Task Optimization

**Breaking Down Complex Tasks:**
```typescript
// Instead of: "Build a complete e-commerce site"
// Try: 
1. "Create product listing component"
2. "Add shopping cart functionality"
3. "Implement checkout process"
4. "Add user authentication"
```

**Iterative Development:**
```typescript
// Progressive refinement
1. "Create basic todo app structure"
2. "Add styling and animations"
3. "Implement data persistence"
4. "Add advanced features"
```
