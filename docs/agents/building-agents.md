## 🧩 Step 2: Add Your First Nodes

### **2.1 Add an Input Node**
1. From the **Node Library**, find **"Input & Output"** section
2. Drag the **"Input"** node to the canvas
3. Click on the Input node to select it
4. In the **Properties Panel**, configure:
   - **Label**: "Content to Analyze"
   - **Description**: "Enter text content for analysis"
   - **Type**: Text
   - **Default Value**: "Sample article content..."

### **2.2 Add an LLM Chat Node**
1. From **"AI & Intelligence"** section, drag **"LLM Chat"** to the canvas
2. Place it to the right of the Input node
3. Configure the LLM node:
   - **API Base URL**: Your AI endpoint (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1`)
   - **API Key**: Your API key
   - **Model**: Your model name (e.g., `gemma3:4b`)
   - **Temperature**: 0.3 (for more focused responses)
   - **Max Tokens**: 500

### **2.3 Add an Output Node**
1. Drag an **"Output"** node to the right of the LLM node
2. This will display the final results

### **2.4 Connect the Nodes**
1. Click and drag from the **Output port** (right side) of the Input node
2. Connect to the **User Message port** (left side) of the LLM node
3. Connect the **Response port** of the LLM node to the **Input port** of the Output node

Your workflow should look like:
```
[Input] → [LLM Chat] → [Output]
```

## ⚙️ Step 3: Configure Advanced Settings

### **3.1 Set Up System Prompt**
1. Click on the **LLM Chat** node
2. In the **System Message** field, enter:

```
You are an expert content analyzer. Analyze the provided text and return a structured analysis including:

1. SENTIMENT: Overall emotional tone (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
2. KEY THEMES: Main topics discussed (max 3)
3. SUMMARY: 2-sentence overview
4. INSIGHTS: 2 actionable insights or recommendations
5. RELEVANCE SCORE: 1-10 rating of content quality/importance

Format your response clearly with headers and bullet points.
```

### **3.2 Test Your Basic Workflow**
1. Click **"Test Flow"** in the toolbar
2. In the Input field, enter:
```
"Our company's new product launch exceeded expectations with 50% higher sales than projected. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, particularly praising the innovative design and user-friendly interface. However, some customers reported minor issues with delivery times."
```
3. Click **"Run"** and observe the results in the Output node
4. Check the **Execution Log** for detailed processing information

## 🔧 Step 4: Enhance with Data Processing

Let's make our analyzer more sophisticated by adding structured output processing.

### **4.1 Add a Structured LLM Node**
1. Add a **"Structured LLM"** node between the LLM Chat and Output
2. Configure it to extract structured data:
   - **API Settings**: Same as LLM Chat node
   - **JSON Schema**: Define the output structure

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "sentiment": {"type": "string", "enum": ["positive", "negative", "neutral"]},
    "confidence": {"type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1},
    "key_themes": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "maxItems": 3},
    "summary": {"type": "string", "maxLength": 200},
    "insights": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}, "maxItems": 2},
    "relevance_score": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 10}
  }
}
```

### **4.2 Add Text Processing**
1. Add a **"Combine Text"** node before the Structured LLM
2. This will combine the original analysis with formatting instructions
3. Configure:
   - **Text 1**: Connect from LLM Chat output
   - **Text 2**: Add static text: "Please format the above analysis as JSON according to the specified schema."
   - **Separator**: "\n\n"

Update your connections:
```
[Input] → [LLM Chat] → [Combine Text] → [Structured LLM] → [Output]
```

## 📊 Step 5: Add Conditional Logic

Let's add smart routing based on content length.

### **5.1 Add an If/Else Node**
1. Insert an **"If/Else"** node after the Input
2. Configure the condition to check text length:
   - **Condition**: `input.length > 1000`
   - **Description**: "Route to detailed analysis for long content"

### **5.2 Create Two Processing Paths**
1. **Long Content Path**: Full analysis with detailed processing
2. **Short Content Path**: Quick analysis with essential insights only

### **5.3 Configure Routing Logic**
- **True Output** (long content) → Detailed LLM analysis
- **False Output** (short content) → Quick LLM analysis

## 🎨 Step 6: Add Multiple Output Formats

### **6.1 Add Output Variants**
1. Create multiple output nodes:
   - **JSON Output**: Structured data for API consumption
   - **Human-Readable Output**: Formatted text for reading
   - **Summary Output**: Key points only

### **6.2 Use JSON Parser**
1. Add **"JSON Parser"** nodes to extract specific fields
2. Configure field extraction:
   - `sentiment` for quick status
   - `summary` for executive overview
   - `insights` for actionable items

## 🧪 Step 7: Test and Debug

### **7.1 Comprehensive Testing**
Test with various content types:

**Short Text (< 1000 chars):**
```
"Great meeting today! Our team is excited about the new project direction."
```
